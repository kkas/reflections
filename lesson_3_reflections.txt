When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  That is because I want to make sure what I am doing, in terms of merging commits to
  the files on local machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Pulling changes from a remote repository means fetching changes and merging them into
  whatevet the branch specified. Therefore, you don't want git to automatically merge
  commits to your branch behind the seen. Rather, you want to make sure what you have
  been doing with the local and remote branches.

  Also, you want to know if changes are commited on the remote repository. By syncing
  changes manually, you will know it when you try to sync.
